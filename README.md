## ABOUT ME

I’m a passionate and detail-oriented Data Analyst and Tech Blogger with a strong foundation in uncovering insights through data. With a background in **History and International Studies**, I bring a unique lens to analysis—combining critical thinking with contextual understanding.

My technical expertise spans tools such as **Python**, **SQL (PostgreSQL)**, **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **Power BI**, **Power Query**, and **ChatGPT** for data automation and storytelling. I’ve worked on projects ranging from customer churn analysis to performance dashboards, always focused on transforming raw data into meaningful, actionable insights.

As a tech blogger, I share practical tutorials, tips, and thought pieces on data tools and trends—helping others navigate the evolving tech landscape. I'm committed to continuous learning and enjoy demystifying technology for others.
